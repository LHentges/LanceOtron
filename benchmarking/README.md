## Benchmarking

Each python benchmarking scripts access its assigned folder to find which peak calls to use from the "peak_calls" directory, calculates performance metrics, and writes a summary (and/or graphs) to the "results" directory. The "helper_scripts" folder has code for normalising and filtering peak calls for the TSS annotation comparisons.

This directory can be used to recreate results presented in our associated article. In addition to the scripts found here, we also reference projects as part of figure 1 and figure 2 which can be found here:
